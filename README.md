Assignment 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
## overview

This notebook focuses on understanding and implementing essential NLP techniques used in text data processing and analysis.
It explores how textual data can be cleaned, tokenized, analyzed, and represented for further modeling or visualization.

## Key Tasks

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Stemming and lemmatization

Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF representations

N-gram and frequency analysis

Sentiment analysis (if applicable)

Visualization of word distributions and word clouds

## Libraries Used

pandas, numpy

nltk, spacy, re

matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud

## Learning Outcomes

Understanding of text preprocessing pipeline

Ability to transform raw text into numerical features

Practical exposure to visualization of linguistic patterns

#### Assignment 2: Computer Vision (CV)
##Overview

This notebook demonstrates key Computer Vision techniques for image analysis and processing using Python.
It covers various transformations and feature extraction methods commonly used in visual data tasks.

## Key Tasks

Reading and displaying images

Image transformations (resize, grayscale, rotate, crop)

Edge detection (Sobel, Canny)

Image filtering and blurring

Feature extraction (SIFT, HOG, CNN features â€“ as applicable)

Simple image classification or segmentation task

## Libraries Used

opencv-python (cv2)

numpy, matplotlib, scikit-image

tensorflow / pytorch (if used)

## Learning Outcomes

Understanding digital image representation

Familiarity with feature extraction and image filters

Hands-on experience with OpenCV and image processing pipelines
